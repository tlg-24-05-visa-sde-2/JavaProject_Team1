## Project Description

### Summary
The dining experience begins when the customer is greeted by the host and seated at a table.
Shortly after, a server approaches to welcome the customer and address any questions about the menu.
The customer reviews the menu options.
Once ready, the ordering process takes place, with the customer selecting their desired items.
The meal is then prepared and served, allowing the customer to enjoy their food.
As the dining experience comes to a close, the server initiates the check-out process.
This includes presenting the bill, processing the payment,
providing a receipt, and allowing the customer to leave a tip.
Finally, the customer departs, concluding their visit to the restaurant.
